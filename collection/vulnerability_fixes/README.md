## Scripts

* [identify.py](identify.py)
  * Contains the function that, given a date, package name, advisory records, and a version to which Dependabot suggest to update (needed for special cases), identifies the set of vulnerabilities that may concern the given security update.
  
* [package_json.py](package_json.py)
  * Contains the function (```package_json_vulnerable```) that, given the package, date, and a set of advisory records, identifies for the specified ```package.json``` file:
    * Whether or not a direct (development or runtime) dependency on the package is present;
    * The constraint on this dependency;
    * Whether the constraint implies that the project is affected by any vulnerability in the provided set
    * The unique identifiers (```GHSA```) of vulnerabilities that affect the repository as follows from the ```package.json``` file
    * The vulnerable version ranges of the package that affect the repository as follows from the ```package.json``` file
    * The list of paths for the workspaces if the project follows the monorepo approach;
  * Contains the function (```package_json_workspaces```) that, given a package and a list of workspaces identifies for the set of the constraints of the direct dependencies on this packages in the workspaces.

* [package_lock_json.py](package_lock_json.py)
  * Contains the function (```package_lock_json_vulnerable```) that, given the package, date, set of advisory records, and whether or not the project has a direct (development or runtime) dependency on this package, identifies for the specified ```package_lock.json``` file:
    * Whether the contents of this file imply that the project is affected by any vulnerability in the provided set or not
    * The unique identifiers (```GHSA```) of vulnerabilities that affect the repository as follows from the ```package_lock.json``` file
    * The vulnerable version ranges of the package that affect the repository as follows from the ```package_lock.json``` file
   
* [yarn_lock.py](yarn_lock.py)
  * Contains the function (```package_lock_json_vulnerable```) that, given the package, date, set of advisory records, and whether or not the project has a direct (development or runtime) dependency on this package, identifies for the specified ```package_lock.json``` file:
    * Whether the contents of this file imply that the project is affected by any vulnerability in the provided set or not
    * The unique identifiers (```GHSA```) of vulnerabilities that affect the repository as follows from the ```package_lock.json``` file
    * The vulnerable version ranges of the package that affect the repository as follows from the ```package_lock.json``` file
