(@​jeremyevans)\nServer supports an array of paths to require for the :require option. (@​khotta)\nFiles supports multipart range requests. (@​fatkodima)\nMultipart::UploadedFile supports an IO-like object instead of using the filesystem, using :filename and :io options.

(@​AlexWayfer)\nAll handlers uses keywords arguments instead of an options hash argument. (@​ioquatix)\nFiles handling of range requests no longer return a body that supports to_path, to ensure range requests are handled correctly. (@​jeremyevans)\nMultipart::Generator only includes Content-Length for files with paths, and Content-Disposition filename if the UploadedFile instance has one. (@​jeremyevans)\n\n ...
