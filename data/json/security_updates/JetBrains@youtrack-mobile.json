This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper.\nThis will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\npublished recently.\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nDue to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n__proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__ in the respect that those expression now return\nundefined rather than their actual value from the proto.\nThe semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n\n{\n  __proto__: 'some string'\n}\n\nThe change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only\nincrease the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\nare not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\nRemote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n\nCommits\nv4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\nBugfixes\n\nfix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\ntest: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nno incompatibility are to be expected\n\n ...
