This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\nfrom the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\nsuch as logout to fail. (:issue:1491)\nThe test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\nprevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n(:issue:1498)\nThe \"werkzeug\" logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\nconfigured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\nlogging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:1492)\n\nVersion 0.15.1\nReleased 2019-03-21\n\n:exc:~exceptions.Unauthorized takes description as the first\n\n ...

This avoids some behavior that was confusing\nto debug.\nChange the default for :data:JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR to\nFalse. :func:~json.jsonify returns a compact format by\ndefault, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:2193\n:meth:Flask.__init__ <Flask> accepts the host_matching\nargument and sets it on :attr:~Flask.url_map. :issue:1559\n:meth:Flask.__init__ <Flask> accepts the static_host argument\nand passes it as the host argument when defining the static\nroute. :issue:1559\n:func:send_file supports Unicode in attachment_filename.\n:pr:2223\nPass _scheme argument from :func:url_for to\n:meth:~Flask.handle_url_build_error. :pr:2017\n:meth:~Flask.add_url_rule accepts the\nprovide_automatic_options argument to disable adding the\nOPTIONS method. :pr:1489\n:class:~views.MethodView subclasses inherit method handlers from\nbase classes. :pr:1936\nErrors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the\nrequest are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:2254\nBlueprints gained :attr:~Blueprint.json_encoder and\n:attr:~Blueprint.json_decoder attributes to override the app's\nencoder and decoder. :pr:1898\n:meth:Flask.make_response raises TypeError instead of\nValueError for bad response types. The error messages have been\nimproved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:2256\nAdd routes CLI command to output routes registered on the\napplication. :pr:2259\nShow warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP\naddress, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as\nChrome. :pr:2282\nAllow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:2282\nSESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN is set if it is detected through\nSERVER_NAME. :pr:2282\nAuto-detect zero-argument app factory called create_app or\nmake_app from FLASK_APP. :pr:2297\nFactory functions are not required to take a script_info\nparameter to work with the flask command.
