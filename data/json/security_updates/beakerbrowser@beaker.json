Fixes compatibility with browsers #3820\n\nTest / internal changes:\n\nUpdate dependencies. Explicitly support Node.js 14 #3825 #3830\n\n0.21.0 - 18 April, 2020\nImprovements\n\nReduce size of lodash in bundle #3804\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDropped support for Node 8\nBreaking upstream change in pg-query-stream: Changed stream.close to stream.destroy which is the official way to terminate a readable stream. This is a breaking change if you rely on the stream.close method on pg-query-stream...though should be just a find/replace type operation to upgrade as the semantics remain very similar (not exactly the same, since internals are rewritten, but more in line with how streams are \"supposed\" to behave).\n\nTest / internal changes:\n\nUpdated Tarn.js to a version 3.0.0\nUpdated mkdirp to a version 1.0.4\nUpdated examples to use ES2015 style #3810\n\n0.20.15 - 16 April, 2020\nBug fixes:\n\nSupport for .finally(..) on knex's Promise-alikes #3800\n\nTypings:\n\nAdd types for .distinctOn #3784\n\n0.20.14 - 13 April, 2020\nNew features:\n\nCLI: adds support for asynchronous knexfile loading #3748\nAdd clearGroup method #3771\n\n ...
