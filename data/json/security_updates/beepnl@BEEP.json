        "bodyText": "Bumps phpoffice/phpspreadsheet from 1.6.0 to 1.8.0.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from phpoffice/phpspreadsheet's releases.\n\n1.8.0\nSecurity Fix (CVE-2019-12331)\n\n\nDetect double-encoded xml in the Security scanner, and reject as suspicious.\n\n\nThis change also broadens the scope of the libxml_disable_entity_loader setting when reading XML-based formats, so that it is enabled while the xml is being parsed and not simply while it is loaded.\nOn some versions of PHP, this can cause problems because it is not thread-safe, and can affect other PHP scripts running on the same server. This flag is set to true when instantiating a loader, and back to its original setting when the Reader is no longer in scope, or manually unset.\n\n\nProvide a check to identify whether libxml_disable_entity_loader is thread-safe or not.\nXmlScanner::threadSafeLibxmlDisableEntityLoaderAvailability()\n\n\nProvide an option to disable the libxml_disable_entity_loader call through settings. This is not recommended as it reduces the security of the XML-based readers, and should only be used if you understand the consequences and have no other choice.\n\n\nAdded\n\nAdded support for the SWITCH function - #963 and #983\nAdd accounting number format style #974\n\nFixed\n\nWhitelist tsv extension when opening CSV files #429\nFix a SUMIF warning with some versions of PHP when having different length of arrays provided as input #873\nFix incorrectly handled backslash-escaped space characters in number format\n\n1.7.0\nAdded\n\nAdded support for inline styles in Html reader (borders, alignment, width, height)\nQuotedText cells no longer treated as formulae if the content begins with a =\nClean handling for DDE in formulae\n\nFixed\n\nFix handling for escaped enclosures and new lines in CSV Separator Inference\nFix MATCH an error was appearing when comparing strings against 0 (always true)\nFix wrong calculation of highest column with specified row #700\nFix VLOOKUP\nFix return type hint\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from phpoffice/phpspreadsheet's changelog.\n\n[1.8.0] -
