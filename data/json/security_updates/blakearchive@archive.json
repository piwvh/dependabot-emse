The error messages have been\nimproved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:2256\nAdd routes CLI command to output routes registered on the\napplication. :pr:2259\nShow warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP\naddress, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as\nChrome. :pr:2282\nAllow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:2282\nSESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN is set if it is detected through\nSERVER_NAME. :pr:2282\nAuto-detect zero-argument app factory called create_app or\nmake_app from FLASK_APP. :pr:2297\nFactory functions are not required to take a script_info\nparameter to work with the flask command.
