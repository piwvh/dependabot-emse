Lodash became the most depended on npm package, passed 1 billion downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\nThe year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on merging Lodash & Underscore. Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 would not be possible without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries.\nFor 2016 & lodash v4.0.0 we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\nModern only\nWith v4 we’re breaking free from old projects, old environments, & dropping old IE < 9 support!\n4 kB Core\nLodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) core build that’s compatible with Backbone v1.2.4 for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\nMore ES6\nWe’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like _.isSymbol, added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable _(…).\nIn addition, we’ve published an es-build & pulled babel-plugin-lodash into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\nMore Modular\nPop quiz! 📣\nWhat category path does the bindAll method belong to? Is it\nA) require('lodash/function/bindAll')\nB) require('lodash/utility/bindAll')\nC) require('lodash/util/bindAll')\nDon’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as\nvar bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\nWe’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async & Redux!\n1st Class FP\nWith v3 we introduced lodash-fp. We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to pull it into core.\nNow you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\nvar _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\n</tr></table> ...
