The integration test for webpack\nshows that it works, but if it doesn't please open an issue.\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2-0 - August 25th, 2019\n#1540 - added browser to package.json, resolves #1102 (@​ouijan)\nCompatibility notes:\n\nWe are not sure if imports via webpack are still working, which is why this release is a pre-release\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019\nChore/Test:\n\n#1515 - Port over linting and test for typings (@​zimmi88)\nchore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3\ntest: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc\n\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: prevent RCE through the \"lookup\"-helper - cd38583\n\nCompatibility notes:\nAccess to the constructor of a class thought {{lookup obj \"constructor\" }} is now prohibited. This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\n ...

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper.\nThis will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\npublished recently.\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nDue to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n__proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__ in the respect that those expression now return\nundefined rather than their actual value from the proto.\nThe semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n\n{\n  __proto__: 'some string'\n}\n\nThe change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only\nincrease the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\nare not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\nRemote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n\nCommits\nv4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\nBugfixes\n\nfix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\ntest: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nno incompatibility are to be expected\n\n ...
