        "bodyText": "Bumps retrofit from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0.\n\nChangelog\nSourced from retrofit's changelog.\n\nVersion 2.5.0 (2018-11-18)\n\nNew: Built-in support for Kotlin's Unit type. This behaves the same as Java's Void where the body\ncontent is ignored and immediately discarded.\nNew: Built-in support for Java 8's Optional and CompletableFuture types. Previously the 'converter-java8'\nand 'adapter-java8' dependencies were needed and explicitly adding Java8OptionalConverterFactory and/or\nJava8CallAdapterFactory to your Retrofit.Builder in order to use these types. Support is now built-in and\nthose types and their artifacts are marked as deprecated.\nNew: Invocation class provides a reference to the invoked method and argument list as a tag on the\nunderlying OkHttp Call. This can be accessed from an OkHttp interceptor for things like logging, analytics,\nor metrics aggregation.\nNew: Kotlin extension for Retrofit which allows you call create passing the interface type only as\na generic parameter (e.g., retrofit.create<MyService>()).\nNew: Added Response.success overload which allows specifying a custom 2xx status code.\nNew: Added Calls.failure overload which allows passing any Throwable subtype.\nNew: Minimal R8 rules now ship inside the jar requiring no client configuration in the common case.\nFix: Do not propagate fatal errors to the callback. They are sent to the thread's uncaught\nexception handler.\nFix: Do not enqueue/execute an otherwise useless call when the RxJava type is disposed by onSubscribe.\nFix: Call RxJavaPlugins assembly hook when creating an RxJava 2 type.\nFix: Ensure both the Guava and Java 8 Optional converters delegate properly. This ensures that converters\nregistered prior to the optional converter can be used for deserializing the body type.\nFix: Prevent @Path values from participating in path-traversal. This ensures untrusted input passed as\na path value cannot cause you to make a request to an un-intended relative URL.\nFix: Simple XML converter (which is deprecated) no longer wraps subtypes of RuntimeException\nor IOException when it fails.\nFix: Prevent JAXB converter from loading remote entities and DTDs.\nFix: Correctly detect default methods in interfaces on Android (API 24+). These still do not work, but\nnow a correct exception will be thrown when detected.\nFix: Report more accurate exceptions when a @QueryName or @QueryMap precedes a @Url parameter.\nUpdate OkHttp dependency to 3.12.\n\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n40621bf [maven-release-plugin] prepare release parent-2.5.0\n8bd6c99 Prepare next development version\n5d6650a Merge pull request #2967 from square/jakew/robo/2018-11-18\n23592bc Merge pull request #2968 from square/jakew/okhhtp/2018-11-18\n01e024b Update OkHttp to 3.12\n7d8dd16 Update Robolectric\nf0cad11 Merge pull request #2962 from square/jakew/completable-future-android/2018-11-16\nbc62069 Merge pull request #2963 from square/jakew/nullability/2018-11-16\n7dcac1d Merge pull request #2964 from square/jakew/header-tests/2018-11-16\n07cb4ae Add tests for form and multipart header values and overrides\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
