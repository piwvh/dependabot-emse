Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file is being passed untrusted user input.\nThis vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier.

(@jeremyevans)\nServer supports an array of paths to require for the :require option. (@khotta)\nFiles supports multipart range requests. (@fatkodima)\nMultipart::UploadedFile supports an IO-like object instead of using the filesystem, using :filename and :io options.

(@jeremyevans)\nEtag will continue sending ETag even if the response should not be cached. (@henm)\nRequest#host_with_port no longer includes a colon for a missing or empty port. (@AlexWayfer)\nAll handlers uses keywords arguments instead of an options hash argument. (@ioquatix)\nFiles handling of range requests no longer return a body that supports to_path, to ensure range requests are handled correctly. (@jeremyevans)\nMultipart::Generator only includes Content-Length for files with paths, and Content-Disposition filename if the UploadedFile instance has one. (@jeremyevans)\n\n ...
