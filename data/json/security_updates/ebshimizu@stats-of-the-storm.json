We suggest\nthat you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n\n\n\nDisallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n\nCalling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in {{blockHelperMissing}} was\nnever intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019\n(see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). It is also part of a new exploit that\nis not captured by the earlier fix. In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers\nis now not possible anymore. Overriding those helpers is still possible.\nIf you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to true and the\ncalls will again be possible\n\n\n\nBoth bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\nWe consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\nCommits\nv4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nThe \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, #1553\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nNo compatibility issues should arise\n\nCommits\nv4.2.0 - September 3rd, 2019\nChore/Test:\n\nUse custom grunt-saucelab with current sauce-connect proxy - f119497\nAdd framework for various integration tests - f9cce4d\n\n ...
