This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495.

Lodash became the most depended on npm package, passed 1 billion downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\nThe year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on merging Lodash & Underscore. Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 would not be possible without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries.\nFor 2016 & lodash v4.0.0 we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\nModern only\nWith v4 weâ€™re breaking free from old projects, old environments, & dropping old IE < 9 support!\n4 kB Core\nLodashâ€™s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) core build thatâ€™s compatible with Backbone v1.2.4 for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\nMore ES6\nWeâ€™ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like _.isSymbol, added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable _(â€¦).\nIn addition, weâ€™ve published an es-build & pulled babel-plugin-lodash into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\nMore Modular\nPop quiz! ðŸ“£\nWhat category path does the bindAll method belong to? Is it\nA) require('lodash/function/bindAll')\nB) require('lodash/utility/bindAll')\nC) require('lodash/util/bindAll')\nDonâ€™t know? Well, with v4 it doesnâ€™t matter because now module paths are as simple as\nvar bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\nWeâ€™ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async & Redux!\n1st Class FP\nWith v3 we introduced lodash-fp. We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to pull it into core.\nNow you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\nvar _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\n</tr></table> ...

        "bodyText": "Bumps handlebars from 4.0.11 to 4.3.0.\n\nChangelog\nSourced from handlebars's changelog.\n\nv4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019\nFixes:\n\nSecurity: Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\nDisallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n\nFeatures:\n\nAdd new runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to allow calling blockHelperMissing and helperMissing.\n\nBreaking changes:\nCompatibility notes:\n\n\nCompiler revision increased - 06b7224\n\nThis means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0\nThe increase was done because the \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" are now moved from the helpers\nto the internal \"container.hooks\" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest\nthat you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n\n\n\nDisallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n\nCalling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in {{blockHelperMissing}} was\nnever intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019\n(see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). It is also part of a new exploit that\nis not captured by the earlier fix. In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers\nis now not possible anymore. Overriding those helpers is still possible.\nIf you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to true and the\ncalls will again be possible\n\n\n\nBoth bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\nWe consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\nCommits\nv4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nThe \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, #1553\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nNo compatibility issues should arise\n\nCommits\nv4.2.0 - September 3rd, 2019\nChore/Test:\n\nUse custom grunt-saucelab with current sauce-connect proxy - f119497\nAdd framework for various integration tests - f9cce4d\n\n ...
