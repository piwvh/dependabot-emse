This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\nv4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n\nRefactorings:\n\nreplace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\nuse \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nThis is a bugfix release. There are no breaking change and no new features.\n\nCommits\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n10b5fcf v4.1.2\ndd0144c Update release notes\n594f1e3 chore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json\n871accc test: remove safari from saucelabs\ncd38583 fix: prevent RCE through the \"lookup\"-helper\nc454d94 Merge pull request #1515 from zimmi88/4.x-typings-lint\n9cfb5dd Merge pull request #1516 from phil-davis/revert-double-release-notes\nbe44246 Remove triplicate of v4.0.12 release notes\n002561b Revert \"Update release notes\"\n3fb6687 Port over linting and test for typings\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
