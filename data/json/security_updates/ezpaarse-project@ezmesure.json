        "bodyText": "Bumps lodash from 2.4.2 to 4.17.15.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from lodash's releases.\n\n4.0.0\nlodash v4.0.0\n2015 was big year! Lodash became the most depended on npm package, passed 1 billion downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\nThe year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on merging Lodash & Underscore. Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 would not be possible without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries.\nFor 2016 & lodash v4.0.0 we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\nModern only\nWith v4 we’re breaking free from old projects, old environments, & dropping old IE < 9 support!\n4 kB Core\nLodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) core build that’s compatible with Backbone v1.2.4 for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\nMore ES6\nWe’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like _.isSymbol, added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable _(…).\nIn addition, we’ve published an es-build & pulled babel-plugin-lodash into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\nMore Modular\nPop quiz! 📣\nWhat category path does the bindAll method belong to? Is it\nA) require('lodash/function/bindAll')\nB) require('lodash/utility/bindAll')\nC) require('lodash/util/bindAll')\nDon’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as\nvar bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\nWe’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async & Redux!\n1st Class FP\nWith v3 we introduced lodash-fp. We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to pull it into core.\nNow you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\nvar _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\n</tr></table> ... (truncated)\n\n\n\nCommits\n\nddfd9b1 Bump to v4.17.15.\nb185fce Rebuild lodash and docs.\nbe87d30 Bump to v4.17.14.\na6fe6b1 Rebuild lodash and docs.\ne371828 Bump to v4.17.13.\n357e899 Rebuild lodash and docs.\nfd9a062 Bump to v4.17.12.\ne77d681 Rebuild lodash and docs.\n629d186 Update OpenJS references.\n2406eac Fix minified build.\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
