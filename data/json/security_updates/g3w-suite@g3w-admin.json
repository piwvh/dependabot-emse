Previously such\nfields were being skipped when read-only or otherwise not required.\nPossible backwards compatibility break if you were relying on such fields being excluded from the outgoing\nrepresentation. In order to restore the old behaviour you can override data to exclude the field when None.\n\n\n ...

        "bodyText": "Bumps lodash from 3.10.1 to 4.17.15.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from lodash's releases.\n\n4.0.0\nlodash v4.0.0\n2015 was big year! Lodash became the most depended on npm package, passed 1 billion downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\nThe year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on merging Lodash & Underscore. Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 would not be possible without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries.\nFor 2016 & lodash v4.0.0 we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\nModern only\nWith v4 we’re breaking free from old projects, old environments, & dropping old IE < 9 support!\n4 kB Core\nLodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) core build that’s compatible with Backbone v1.2.4 for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\nMore ES6\nWe’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like _.isSymbol, added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable _(…).\nIn addition, we’ve published an es-build & pulled babel-plugin-lodash into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\nMore Modular\nPop quiz! 📣\nWhat category path does the bindAll method belong to? Is it\nA) require('lodash/function/bindAll')\nB) require('lodash/utility/bindAll')\nC) require('lodash/util/bindAll')\nDon’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as\nvar bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\nWe’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async & Redux!\n1st Class FP\nWith v3 we introduced lodash-fp. We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to pull it into core.\nNow you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\nvar _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\n</tr></table> ...
