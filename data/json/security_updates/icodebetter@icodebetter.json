It is compatible with 4.7.x. All users of the 4.x.x and 3.6.x series are encouraged to use this version.\nNote that as of this release, default DNS resolution on the server hostname is disabled when using TLS (#400). This avoids interfering with hostname verification (#394). DNS resolution can be easily re-enabled by passing in a DnsRecordIpAddressResolver instance to one the ConnectionFactory#newConnection methods.\nThanks to @​vikinghawk for his contribution on this release.\nChanges between 4.7.0 and 4.8.0\nMake it easier to enable hostname verification when TLS is enabled\nGitHub issue: #394\nDisable DNS resolution when using TLS\nGitHub issue: #400\nAdd filter to skip some entities on topology recovery\nGitHub issue: #383\nAdd optional retry logic to topology recovery\nGitHub issue: #387\nAddress parser is incapable of handling IPv6 address literals\nGitHub issue: #385\nImprove JSON RPC support by using Jackson\nGitHub issue: #378\nAdd equals and hashCode to generated classes\nGitHub issue: #377\nAdd dedicated executor to close connections in NIO mode\nGitHub issue: #380\n4.8.0.RC3\nThis is a pre-release for 4.8.0, a maintenance release with new features.
