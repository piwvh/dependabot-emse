This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\nv4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n\nRefactorings:\n\nreplace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\nuse \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nThis is a bugfix release.

        "bodyText": "Bumps handlebars from 4.1.2 to 4.5.3.\n\nChangelog\nSourced from handlebars's changelog.\n\nv4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: add \"no-prototype-builtins\" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7\nfix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878\n\nChores / Build:\n\nfix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f\nadd chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies,\ndeprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0\n\nSecurity:\n\nThe properties __proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__\nhave been added to the list of \"properties that must be enumerable\".\nIf a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent,\nit will silently evaluate to undefined. This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper.\nThis will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\npublished recently.\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nDue to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n__proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__ in the respect that those expression now return\nundefined rather than their actual value from the proto.\nThe semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n\n{\n  __proto__: 'some string'\n}\n\nThe change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only\nincrease the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\nare not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\nRemote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n\nCommits\nv4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\nBugfixes\n\nfix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\ntest: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nno incompatibility are to be expected\n\n ...
