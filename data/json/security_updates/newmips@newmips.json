If any of the two contained a string with a double quote in it, then that would enable an SQL injection. This was previously a feature of tableName, before the introduction of a separate schemaName, as that allowed a schema to be defined as part of tableName. Defining schema name through tableName is still supported after this fix, but is now deprecated.\nFix: Errors wasn't propagated properly. Fixed in #150. Thanks @â€‹bobnil!\n\nvoxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple@v6.0.0...v6.0.1\nv6.0.0\n\nBreaking change: Now requires at least Node.js 10.x, this as Node.js 8.x only have a short time left in its LTS\nBreaking change: This project now uses INSERT ... ON CONFLICT, more popularly known as UPSERT. This is only supported on PostgreSQL version 9.5 and above.\nUpdate pg-promise dev dependency to 9.x\nListen on pool errors.
