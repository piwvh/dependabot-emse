The integration test for webpack\nshows that it works, but if it doesn't please open an issue.\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2-0 - August 25th, 2019\n#1540 - added browser to package.json, resolves #1102 (@â€‹ouijan)\nCompatibility notes:\n\nWe are not sure if imports via webpack are still working, which is why this release is a pre-release\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019\nChore/Test:\n\n#1515 - Port over linting and test for typings (@â€‹zimmi88)\nchore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3\ntest: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc\n\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: prevent RCE through the \"lookup\"-helper - cd38583\n\nCompatibility notes:\nAccess to the constructor of a class thought {{lookup obj \"constructor\" }} is now prohibited. This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\n ...

The integration test for webpack\nshows that it works, but if it doesn't please open an issue.\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2-0 - August 25th, 2019\n#1540 - added browser to package.json, resolves #1102 (@â€‹ouijan)\nCompatibility notes:\n\nWe are not sure if imports via webpack are still working, which is why this release is a pre-release\n\nCommits\nv4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019\nChore/Test:\n\n#1515 - Port over linting and test for typings (@â€‹zimmi88)\nchore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3\ntest: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc\n\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: prevent RCE through the \"lookup\"-helper - cd38583\n\nCompatibility notes:\nAccess to the constructor of a class thought {{lookup obj \"constructor\" }} is now prohibited. This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\n ...
