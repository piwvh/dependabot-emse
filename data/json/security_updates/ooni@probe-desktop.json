For future security related communications of our OSS projects, please join this mailing list.\nNext.js has just been audited by one of the top security firms in the world.\nThey found that attackers could craft special requests to access files in the dist directory (.next).\nThis does not affect files outside of the dist directory (.next).\nIn general, the dist directory only holds build assets unless your application intentionally stores other assets under this directory.\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js to improve the overall security of your application.\nHow to Upgrade\n\nWe have released patch versions for both the stable and canary channels of Next.js.\nTo upgrade run npm install next@latest --save\n\nImpact\n\nNot affected: Deployments on ZEIT Now v2 (https://zeit.co) are not affected\nNot affected: Deployments using the serverless target\nNot affected: Deployments using next export\nAffected: Users of Next.js below 9.3.2 that use next start\n\nWe recommend everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.\nHow to Assess Impact\nIf you think sensitive code or data could have been exposed, you can filter logs of affected sites by ../ with a 200 response.\nWhat is Being Done\nAs Next.js has grown in popularity, it has received the attention of security researchers and auditors. We are thankful to Luca Carettoni from Doyensec for their investigation and discovery of the original bug and subsequent responsible disclosure.\nWe've landed a patch that ensures only known filesystem paths of .next/static are made available under /_next/static.\nRegression tests for this attack were added to the security integration test suite.\n\nWe have notified known Next.js users in advance of this publication.\nA public CVE was issued.\nIf you want to stay on top of our security related news impacting Next.js or other ZEIT projects, please join this mailing list.\nWe encourage responsible disclosure of future issues. Please email us at security@zeit.co. We are actively monitoring this mailbox.\n\n\nPatches\n\nAdd Numeric Separator Support for TypeScript: #11308\nUpdate CLI custom config documentation link: #11152\nAdd error when attempting to export GSSP page: #11154\n\n ...
