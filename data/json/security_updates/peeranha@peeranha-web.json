        "bodyText": "Bumps bootstrap from 4.1.3 to 4.3.1.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from bootstrap's releases.\n\nv4.3.1\n\nSecurity: Fixed an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-8331) in our tooltip and popover plugins by implementing a new HTML sanitizer\nFixed a small issue with our RFS (responsive font sizes) mixins\n\nv4.3.0\nHighlights\n\nNew: Added .stretched-link utility to make any anchor the size of it's nearest position: relative parent, perfect for entirely clickable cards!\nNew: Added .text-break utility for applying word-break: break-word\nNew: Added .rounded-sm and .rounded-lg for small and large border-radius.\nNew: Added .modal-dialog-scrollable modifier class for scrolling content within a modal.\nNew: Added responsive .list-group-horizontal modifier classes for displaying list groups as a horizontal row.\nImproved: Reduced our compiled CSS by using null for variables that by default inherit their values from other elements (e.g., $headings-color was inherit and is now null until you modifier it in your custom CSS).\nImproved: Badge focus styles now match their background-color like our buttons.\nFixed: Silenced bad selectors in our JS plugins for the href HTML attribute to avoid JavaScript errors. Please try to use valid selectors or the data-target HTML attribute/target option where available.\nFixed: Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.\nFixed: Restored white-space: nowrap to .dropdown-toggle (before v4.2.1 it was on all .btns) so carets don't wrap to new lines.\nDeprecated: img-retina, invisible, float, and size mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\n\nLinks\n\nRead the full ship list\nReview the project board\n\nv4.2.1\nBump to v4.2.1 to republish package on npm. See v4.2.0 release notes for changes introduced in v4.2.\nv4.2.0\nHere are the highlights of what's new and updated in v4.2.\n\nNew: Added a new spinner loading component.\nNew: Added new toast component for displaying notifications.\nNew: Added a new iOS style switch (a modifier class to our custom checkboxes).\nNew: Added touch support in our carousel component.\nNew: Added .font-weight-lighter and .font-weight-bolder utilities.\nNew: Added .text-decoration-none utility class.\nNew: Added .modal-xl modifier class for our modals.\nNew: Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., .mb-n3). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.\nNew: Validated form fields now have feedback icons on :invalid and :valid fields. Disable them with the $enable-validation-icons boolean Sass variable (defaults to true).\nNew: Added a new versions page to our docs\nNew: Tooltips/Popovers work with Shadow DOM\nUpdated: Redesigned the custom checkboxes and radios for more obvious states.\nUpdated: bootstrap-grid.css now includes our margin and padding utilities for full control of our grid system.\nUpdated: Changed auto columns (e.g., .col-auto) from max-width: none to max-width: 100% to prevent content from causing a column to overflow the parent.\nUpdated: Improved rendering of custom selects, ranges, file input, and more.\n\nCheckout the full v4.2.0 ship list and GitHub project for the full details. Up next is v4.3 with some bugfixes, a few new modifier classes and variables, and some new utilities.\nHead to to the v4.2.x docs to see the latest in action. The full release has been published to npm and will soon appear on the Bootstrap CDN and Rubygems.\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n8fa0d30 Release v4.3.1. (#28252)\ndae20da Remove unneeded glob.
