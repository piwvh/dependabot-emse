This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\nv4.0.13 - February 7th, 2019\nNew Features\n\nnone\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\ndisallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, #1495\n\nHousekeeping\n\nchore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473\nchore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c\n\nCompatibility notes:\nAccess to class constructors (i.e. ({}).constructor) is now prohibited to prevent\nRemote Code Execution. This means that following construct will no work anymore:\nclass SomeClass {\n}\n\nSomeClass.staticProperty = 'static'\n\nvar template = Handlebars.compile('{{constructor.staticProperty}}');\ndocument.getElementById('output').innerHTML = template(new SomeClass());\n// expected: 'static', but now this is empty.\n\n ...
