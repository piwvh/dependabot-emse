Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file is being passed untrusted user input.\nThis vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.\nThis CVE's public notice is #1915\n1.10.3 / 2019-04-22\nSecurity Notes\n[MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxslt that addresses CVE-2019-11068. Full details are available in #1892. Note that this patch is not yet (as of 2019-04-22) in an upstream release of libxslt.\n1.10.2 / 2019-03-24\nSecurity\n\n[MRI] Remove support from vendored libxml2 for future script macros. #1871\n[MRI] Remove support from vendored libxml2 for server-side includes within attributes. #1877\n\nBug fixes\n\n[JRuby] Fix node ownership in duplicated documents. #1060\n[JRuby] Rethrow exceptions caught by Java SAX handler. [#1847, #1872] (Thanks, @​adjam!)\n\n1.10.1 / 2019-01-13\nFeatures\n\n[MRI] During installation, handle Xcode 10's new library pathOS. [#1801, #1851] (Thanks, @​mlj and @​deepj!)\nAvoid unnecessary creation of Procs in many methods. #1776 (Thanks, @​chopraanmol1!)\n\nBug fixes\n\nCSS selector :has() now correctly matches against any descendant. Previously this selector matched against only direct children). #350 (Thanks, @​Phrogz!)\nNodeSet#attr now returns nil if it's empty. Previously this raised a NoMethodError.\n[MRI] XPath errors are no longer suppressed during XSLT::Stylesheet#transform.
