This makes it possible to distinguish logs generated by different threads.\nFixes permissions issue on Linux when setting OOM score after lowering privileges. Closes GH-1858.\n[Standalone] Allows raw json envvars in Passengerfile.json. Closes GH-1837.\n[Standalone] Make the max_requests option available on the command line as well.\nFixes unaligned memory access in base64 decoder on platforms that have strict aliasing requirements (non x86/x86_64). Closes GH-1646.\nIntroduces daily Passenger security update check to warn (error log) if there are newer Passenger versions with important security fixes (describing what was discovered, what is affected, which version has the fix).\nFixes compilation on Linux when a non-glibc C library is in use. Closes GH-1870.\npassenger-install-nginx-module and the standalone compiler now add the http v2, realip and addition module flags for Nginx (just like the APT/RPM/autobuilder already had). Closes GH-1788.\n[Apache] Fixes PassengerShowVersionInHeader option. Thanks to Sebastian Welther for contributing this.\nPassenger now reports when you try to use Node.js or Meteor clustering, and tries to continue with just a nonfunctional shim in place, so that if your code uses the clustering APIs your app may still work.\nUpdates libev config.sub and config.guess to support newer platforms such as the IBM power 8.\nFixes an issue where passenger-config couldn't restart an app if the TMPDIR variable was set to /tmp\npassenger-install-apache-module now suggests the correct apache package on Ubuntu Xenial. Closes GH-1884.\n[Standalone] The TempDirToucher will now spend most of its time with reduced privileges, except when it's actively touching files. This allows it to be killed when Passenger is quit in most circumstances. Closes GH-1678.\nFixes a file overwrite vulnerability (CVE-2016-10345) caused by a predictable temporary file being written by passenger-install-nginx-module. Thanks to Jeremy Evans for reporting this.\n[Standalone] Fixes starting Passenger as a non-extant user. Closes GH-1849.\nImproved look of the error pages for failing to spawn an application (development & production mode), and Error ID is now also shown in production mode.\n[Standalone] Enable ipv6 support by default in builtin nginx. Closes GH-1873.\n[Nginx] Updates to APT package builder (Debian & Ubuntu) with fix for www-data to root privilege escalation via log file handling (CVE-2016-1247/USN-3114-1).\n[Nginx] Updates to RPM package builder (CentOS & RHEL) with fix for 1.10.x system nginx package overriding the nginx from the Passenger repo. Closes GH-1895.\n[Nginx] The preferred Nginx version is now 1.10.2 (previously 1.10.1).\nRPM pkg builder fix for breaking SELinux change in RHEL 7.3.\nRPM pkg builder fix for RHEL6/CentOS6 incompatibility and replacement in Passenger.\nAdds Ubuntu 16.10 \"Yakkety\" packages.\n\nRelease 5.0.30\n\nChanges mbuf block size from 512 to 4096 bytes to better fit modern requests and significantly speed up disk buffering.\n[Nginx] Fixes PCRE checksum after the preferred version update in 5.0.29 (contributed by: clemensg).\n[Apache] Fixes buffer limit crash on large file upload (when core disk buffer can't keep up with client for some time), and limits per-client buffer memory usage to 130 KB. Closes GH-1620.\nFixes potential hang when an UnseekableSocket gets serialized to json. Closes GH-1838.\n\nRelease 5.0.29\n\nFixes the FreeBSD build breaking due to the -ldl flag introduced by the LVE integration patch (5.0.28). Closes GH-1805.\nFixes per-application interpreter override (ruby, node, python) being ignored in mass deployment mode. Closes GH-1818.\nFixes incomplete refactor from 5.0.27 that could, under specific conditions, lead to a Passenger crash. Closes GH-1794.\n[Apache] Remove unused code that caused a crash in configurations with thousands of VirtualHost entries. Closes GH-1676.\n[Nginx] Fixes use of invalid logfile name (memory already released) in backup log redirection code. Possibly related to GH-1774.\n[Nginx] The preferred Nginx version is now 1.10.1 (previously 1.10.0).\n[Nginx] The preferred PCRE version is now 8.39 (previously 8.34).\n[Standalone] Passenger Standalone now supports /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr as log file path (via --log-file or Passengerfile.json). This is especially useful in Docker containers. In previous versions logging to those paths did not work, resulting in nothing getting logged at all.\n\n ...
