This closes\na leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\nThis kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\nin #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented,\nand because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\nand the issue may not be resolved on many systems).\nCommits\nv4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n\nRefactorings:\n\nreplace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\nuse \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nThis is a bugfix release. There are no breaking change and no new features.\n\nCommits\nv4.1.0 - February 7th, 2019\nNew Features\n\nimport TypeScript typings - 27ac1ee\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\ndisallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, #1495\n\nHousekeeping\n\nchore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473\nchore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c\nchore/doc: Add more release docs - 6b87c21\n\n ...
