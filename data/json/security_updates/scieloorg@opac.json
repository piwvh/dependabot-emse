(:issue:1511)\nUpdate :class:~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware to work on Python 3.\n(:issue:1510)\nThe debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\nout in that case. (:issue:1536)\nWhen running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\npin is now unique per container.\n\nVersion 0.15.2\nReleased 2019-04-02\n\nRule code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\nThe previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n(:issue:1487)\nThe test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\ncookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\nfrom the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\nsuch as logout to fail. (:issue:1491)\nThe test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\nprevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n(:issue:1498)\nThe \"werkzeug\" logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\nconfigured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\nlogging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:1492)\n\nVersion 0.15.1\nReleased 2019-03-21\n\n:exc:~exceptions.Unauthorized takes description as the first\n\n ...

        "bodyText": "Bumps flask from 0.12.4 to 1.0.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from flask's releases.\n\n1.0\nThe Pallets team is pleased to release Flask 1.0. [Read the announcement on our blog.](https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/\nThere are over a year's worth of changes in this release. Many features have been improved or changed. Read the changelog to understand how your project's code will be affected.\nJSON Security Fix\nFlask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.\nFlask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.\nInstall or Upgrade\nInstall from PyPI with pip:\npip install -U Flask\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from flask's changelog.\n\nVersion 1.0\nReleased 2018-04-26\n\nPython 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.\nBump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:\nWerkzeug >= 0.14, Jinja >= 2.10, itsdangerous >= 0.24, Click >= 5.1.\n:issue:2586\nSkip :meth:app.run <Flask.run> when a Flask application is run\nfrom the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing\nto debug.\nChange the default for :data:JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR to\nFalse. :func:~json.jsonify returns a compact format by\ndefault, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:2193\n:meth:Flask.__init__ <Flask> accepts the host_matching\nargument and sets it on :attr:~Flask.url_map. :issue:1559\n:meth:Flask.__init__ <Flask> accepts the static_host argument\nand passes it as the host argument when defining the static\nroute. :issue:1559\n:func:send_file supports Unicode in attachment_filename.\n:pr:2223\nPass _scheme argument from :func:url_for to\n:meth:~Flask.handle_url_build_error. :pr:2017\n:meth:~Flask.add_url_rule accepts the\nprovide_automatic_options argument to disable adding the\nOPTIONS method. :pr:1489\n:class:~views.MethodView subclasses inherit method handlers from\nbase classes. :pr:1936\nErrors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the\nrequest are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:2254\nBlueprints gained :attr:~Blueprint.json_encoder and\n:attr:~Blueprint.json_decoder attributes to override the app's\nencoder and decoder. :pr:1898\n:meth:Flask.make_response raises TypeError instead of\nValueError for bad response types. The error messages have been\nimproved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:2256\nAdd routes CLI command to output routes registered on the\napplication. :pr:2259\nShow warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP\naddress, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as\nChrome. :pr:2282\nAllow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:2282\nSESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN is set if it is detected through\nSERVER_NAME. :pr:2282\nAuto-detect zero-argument app factory called create_app or\nmake_app from FLASK_APP. :pr:2297\nFactory functions are not required to take a script_info\nparameter to work with the flask command. If they take a single\nparameter or a parameter named script_info, the\n\n ...
