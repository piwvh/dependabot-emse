Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.\nThat is why we only bump the minor version despite mentioning breaking changes\n\n\nCommits\nv4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019\nBugfixes:\n\nfix: add \"no-prototype-builtins\" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7\nfix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878\n\nChores / Build:\n\nfix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f\nadd chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies,\ndeprecate old assertion-methods - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0\n\nSecurity:\n ...
