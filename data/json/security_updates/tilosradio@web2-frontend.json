        "bodyText": "Bumps pouchdb from 5.3.2 to 7.1.1.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from pouchdb's releases.\n\n7.1.1\nwe have another PouchDB release. The main improvements in this release are bug fixes and dependency updates.\nFor a full changelog from 7.0 to 7.1.0, please see the releases page or view the latest commits.\nGet in touch\nAs always, we welcome feedback from the community and would love to hear what you think of this release as well as PouchDB's future direction. Please don't hesitate to file issues or get in touch. And of course, a big thanks to all of our new and existing contributors!\nIf you wondering where is 7.1.0, I had a slight publishing issue so the easiest was to bump it up to 7.1.1 to do a fresh deploy.\n7.0.0\nAs promised back in January it is time to drop WebSQL from our default builds. This not only lets us focus our development efforts on a single engine but along with the other changes explained below reduces the default PouchDB package size from 148KB to 122KB, thats 17.5% smaller!\nRemoved WebSQL\n#6943 - The WebSQL adapter is still available to download and use, it will no longer be available as part of a default PouchDB build and will eventually be moved to the pouchdb-community repo. If you need to migrate your users from WebSQL to IndexeDB then there is some advice available in our previous release post.\nRemoved Promise Polyfill\n#6945 - Including our own Promise polyfill means larger bundles when most apps already include their own polyfill if they need it. So if you support browsers which do not support Promises natively you will need to include a polyfill yourself. We use promise-polyfill and have found it to work great.\nSwitch to fetch\n#6944 - This is another API that may need polyfilled if you use PouchDB and support IE, we use whatwg-fetch. Switching to fetch has allowed us to expose the ability to intercept the requests PouchDB makes for more flexibility, such as:\nvar db = new PouchDB('http://example.com/dbname', {\n  fetch: function (url, opts) {\n    opts.headers.set('X-Some-Special-Header', 'foo');\n    return PouchDB.fetch(url, opts);\n  }\n});\nThat will add a X-Some-Special-Header to every HTTP request PouchDB makes.\nDeterministic Revisions\n#4642 - We now match CouchDB default behaviour and use the documents contents to determine its revision, this means automated conflict resolution handlers are less likely to generate extra conflicts.\nMore Deprecations\n\n#6946 - Remove debug dep\n#7134 - Remove IndexedDB storage option\n#6944 - Remove deprecated skipSetup\n\nFixes\n\n#7040 - Use fixed-length array in idb/indexeddb allDocs\n\n ... (truncated)\n\n\n\nCommits\n\na379318 build 7.1.1\n0f66082 (7799) - release post for 7.1.1\n3ea28a7 (7799) - release post for 7.1\n4af8be5 (#7798) - chore: pin node-fetch to 2.4.1\nbb2b23f (#7790) - matchSelector function object error\n5517474 (#7786) - fix(package): update levelup to version 4.0.2\n9e044ff (#7794) - update node on travis to version 10\nad860cb (#7745) fix: handle corrupt rev tree\n07b11ad (#7773) - chore(package): update tape to version 4.10.2\n2916cbd (#7769) - chore(package): update uglify-js to version 3.5.14\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\nMaintainer changes\nThis version was pushed to npm by garrensmith, a new releaser for pouchdb since your current version.\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
