This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\nfrom the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\nsuch as logout to fail. (:issue:1491)\nThe test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\nprevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n(:issue:1498)\nThe \"werkzeug\" logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\nconfigured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\nlogging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:1492)\n\nVersion 0.15.1\nReleased 2019-03-21\n\n:exc:~exceptions.Unauthorized takes description as the first\n\n ...
