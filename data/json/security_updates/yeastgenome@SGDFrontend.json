This\n  is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n  responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n  Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n  connection after the response is sent.\n\n- Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n  and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n  vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n  back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n\nSecurity Fixes\n\n\n\nWaitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\nAlthough the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\nthe sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\nterminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n\nUnfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\nthe same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\nthe back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\ncan lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\nmay see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\nmessage.\nFor more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\nhttps://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/\n\n\nWaitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in Transfer-Encoding: chunked\nrequests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security\nissue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be\nproperly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.\n\n\nWaitress now validates that the Transfer-Encoding header contains only\ntransfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the\nonly valid header value being chunked.\nThat means that if the following header is sent:\nTransfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\n\n\n ...
