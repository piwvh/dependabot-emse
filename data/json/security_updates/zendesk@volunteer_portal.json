Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file is being passed untrusted user input.\nThis vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries.

Full details are available in #1892. Note that this patch is not yet (as of 2019-04-22) in an upstream release of libxslt.\n1.10.2 / 2019-03-24\nSecurity\n\n[MRI] Remove support from vendored libxml2 for future script macros. #1871\n[MRI] Remove support from vendored libxml2 for server-side includes within attributes. #1877\n\nBug fixes\n\n[JRuby] Fix node ownership in duplicated documents. #1060\n[JRuby] Rethrow exceptions caught by Java SAX handler.

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper.\nThis will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\npublished recently.\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nDue to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n__proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__ and __lookupGetter__ in the respect that those expression now return\nundefined rather than their actual value from the proto.\nThe semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n\n{\n  __proto__: 'some string'\n}\n\nThe change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only\nincrease the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\nare not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\nRemote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n\nCommits\nv4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\nBugfixes\n\nfix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\ntest: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\nno incompatibility are to be expected\n\n ...
